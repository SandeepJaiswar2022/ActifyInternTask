#  React, Springboot Actify APP

This is a basic web application built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend(only few endpoints to interact with database).The frontend is responsive, supporting both mobile and desktop views.

## Features
- **Frontend**: Built with React, using `react-router-dom` for routing, `redux-toolkit` for state management, and `axios` for API calls.
- **Backend**: Developed with Spring Boot to handle REST API requests and manage database operations.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for mobile and desktop devices. Screenshots below showcase the difference between mobile and desktop views.
